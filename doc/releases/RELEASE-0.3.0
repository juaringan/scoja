 RELEASE 0.3.0
---------------

- Unix sockets are finally operative.
  It is possible to read /dev/log with the source fromUnixStream.
  So, for the first time, Scoja is a real replacement for syslogd
  and syslog-ng.
  
- The native code has been reorganized and completed.
  All Posix capabilities are in a single interface (PosixLike).
  There is an always-failing implementation in pure Java (PosixFree),
  and one native implementation for each system supported.
  Currently, there is only one native implementation: for a Posix-complaint
  system.
  
- "confine" function to limit how many different values a variable can
  take in a finite amount of time.
