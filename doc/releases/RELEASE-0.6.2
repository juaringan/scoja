- New options for sockets: SO_DEBUG, SO_KEEPALIVE, SO_LINGER, TCP_NODELAY.

  and ReusingUnixStreamSyslogger.

- Pol has contributed an appender for log4j.
  Although a syslog appender exists in standard log4j distribution, this
  one has many more characteristics: can send to multiple destinations,
