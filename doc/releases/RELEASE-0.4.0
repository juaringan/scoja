 RELEASE 0.4.0
---------------

- Binding an UDP socket doesn't work properly.
  So, there is no way to enable address reusing.
  To avoid making a decision at source code, fromUDP source has now an
  attribute to enable this option.
  Of course, enabling it will raise a runtime error.
  
- ReflectiveEntity operative.
  Now, it is pretty easy to install objects extracted from an
  arbitrary property or from the execution of an static method.
  This is used for --secure-with and --posix-provider options.

- Recoja utility almost complete.
  It has good enough performance.
  We have implemented a read ahead and delayed writes ability,
  but our tests have proved no impact on performance.
  May be they are useful in a multiprocessor machine.
  Recoja utility classes are in the same .jar that Scoja server (scoja.jar);
  no plan to split scoja.jar because both programs share several classes.
