 RELEASE 0.10.0
----------------

- Small changes to LimitFilter: more detailed data send to the internal log.

- "include" has been extended with glob patterns to load several files.

- A new counter link that keeps several measures indexed with a template.
  It is useful when taking statistics by the tag content.

 TODO
------

- En StdSyslogEventParser.trim: cambiar el paso de bytes a char por un CharSet.
  Esto hay que probar cómo influye en los rendimientos.
  
- Consider to substitute NIO code with Grizzly or QuickServer.

- Configurable parsers. At least, a way to configure white space trimming.

- Accept several events in one UDP packet.

- A faster Scoja native configuration files load code.

- A pool of open server sockets.
  Configuration files don't open/close this objects directly.
  So reloading updated configuration files doesn't have problems with
  still opened sockets.
  
- What about message enconding?
  Now code supposes that Latin1 encoding is used.
  This should be configurable for the message body.

- Translate this fucking proyect to english.

- A lot of JUnit tests.

- mapping should have a fail mode: if key is not found, event will not pass.
  There is a problem to implement this functionality:
  mapping are expression and only links can block events.
  The simplest solution is to return a null to mark that the expression
  evaluation failed and the event cannot pass.

- useSendTimestamp should change default timestamp only for the logging
  net following this action.
  
- Avoid all Python composition at Java code.
  It is easier to cover Java objects with Python object that take care
  of link and expression composition.

- Recoja:
  Set user, group and mode of the generated files.
  
- SSL, in Scoja and events routing.

- Acoja utility.

- xSockets can be a good base for network sources.

- See rsyslog.

- RELP: Reliable Event Logging Protocol.

- Netflow

- SNMP

- WebSockets to do data transfer through a proxy.
