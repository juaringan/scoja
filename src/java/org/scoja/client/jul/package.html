<body>
This is a syslog plugin to the JUL (java.util.logging) logging package.
Its main goal is to fine-control the mapping from JUL to syslog.

<p><b>Syslog concepts</b>
In JUL, the base logging method is
{@link java.util.logging.Logger#log(LogRecord)}.
The LogRecord class has no extension capability to configure the behaviour of
special handlers.
This package introduces {@link AttributedLogRecord} as a general way to
add attributes that handlers can look for in order to change their behaviour.
All handlers in this package check whether the received LogRecord is a
AttributedLogRecord, and search for a SyslogAttribute attribute.
<p>
Nevertheless, it is not necessary to work with LogRecords neither with
SyslogAttribute in the code.
The configuration proccess is flexible enough to introduce syslog info.

<p><b>Handlers</b>
This package defines 2 Handlers, that are usually used chained.
The {@link org.scoja.client.jul.SyslogHandler} handler is the base syslog
sender.
See its javadoc for its capabilities.
Its main goal is to send a log record to a syslog collector.
<p>
The {@link org.scoja.client.jul.MessageSyslogAttributer} is a enhacing handler.
Its goal is to enrich the current LogRecord with a SyslogAttribute.
See its javadoc for the details and a some configuration examples.

<p><b>Layout</b>
When producing a syslog message, both the program and the message should be
built from data in the log record.
The handlers in this package allow a layout microlanguage to define the way
that those two parts are constructed.
The microlanguage is defined in {@link org.scoja.client.jul.EventLayout}.
When a property is specified as needing a layout, it will be given to
EventLayout for interpretation.
