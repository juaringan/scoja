This package is an extension of Java IO capabilities.
In fact, several Posix IO facilities are implemented trying to imitate,
as much as possible, standard Java IO APIs and semantics.

<h3>Socket options</h3>
There are a lot of socket options, not all having a descriptive name.
In this section purpose is to collect information for this options:
an explanation and when and for which kind of socket is sensible to use
each of them.

<p>
(Copied from GNU libc manual):
<dl>
<dt>SO_DEBUG
<dd>This option toggles recording of debugging information in the
    underlying protocol modules. The value has type int; a nonzero value
    means <b>yes</b>.
    
<dt>SO_REUSEADDR
<dd>This option controls whether bind (see Setting Address) should
    permit reuse of local addresses for this socket. If you enable this
    option, you can actually have two sockets with the same Internet port
    number; but the system won't allow you to use the two
    identically-named sockets in a way that would confuse the
    Internet. The reason for this option is that some higher-level
    Internet protocols, including FTP, require you to keep reusing the
    same port number. 
    <p>
    The value has type int; a nonzero value means <b>yes</b>.

<dt>SO_KEEPALIVE
<dd>This option controls whether the underlying protocol should
    periodically transmit messages on a connected socket. If the peer
    fails to respond to these messages, the connection is considered
    broken. The value has type int; a nonzero value means
    <b>yes</b>.

<dt>SO_DONTROUTE
<dd>This option controls whether outgoing messages bypass the normal
    message routing facilities. If set, messages are sent directly to the
    network interface instead. The value has type int; a nonzero value
    means <b>yes</b>.

<dt>SO_LINGER
<dd>This option specifies what should happen when the socket of a type
    that promises reliable delivery still has untransmitted messages
    when it is closed; see Closing a Socket. The value has type struct
    linger. 
    <p>
    Data Type: <b>struct linger</b>
    This structure type has the following members:
    <dl>
    <dt>int l_onoff
    <dd>This field is interpreted as a boolean. If nonzero, close
        blocks until the data are transmitted or the timeout period has
        expired. 
    <dt>int l_linger
    <dd>This specifies the timeout period, in seconds. 
    </dl>

<dt>SO_BROADCAST
<dd>This option controls whether datagrams may be broadcast from the
    socket. The value has type int; a nonzero value means
    <b>yes</b>.

<dt>SO_OOBINLINE
<dd>If this option is set, out-of-band data received on the socket is
    placed in the normal input queue. This permits it to be read using
    read or recv without specifying the MSG_OOB flag. See Out-of-Band
    Data. The value has type int; a nonzero value means
    <b>yes</b>.

<dt>SO_SNDBUF
<dd>This option gets or sets the size of the output buffer. The value
    is a size_t, which is the size in bytes.
    
<dt>SO_RCVBUF
<dd>This option gets or sets the size of the input buffer. The value
    is a size_t, which is the size in bytes.
    
<dt>SO_STYLE, SO_TYPE
<dd>This option can be used with getsockopt only. It is used to get
    the socket's communication style. SO_TYPE is the historical name,
    and SO_STYLE is the preferred name in GNU. The value has type int
    and its value designates a communication style; see Communication
    Styles.

<dt>SO_ERROR
<dd>This option can be used with getsockopt only. It is used to reset
    the error status of the socket. The value is an int, which
    represents the previous error status.
