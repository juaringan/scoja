Source code for <tt>recoja</tt> utility.
Recoja consolidates logs collected with several balanced Scoja.

<p>
The solution that we have chosen to make scoja work in a distributed
balaced setting is pretty simple: each scoja instance writes to a
different file because paths in configurations files always
contains one of
  <tt>$MYIP</tt>, <tt>$MYHOST</tt>, <tt>$MYCCHOST</tt> or <tt>$ME</tt>.
With this solution there is no need to use file locking or other
heavy-weighted synchronization mechanism.
But log contents are split in several files.
This utility consolidates these files.
It is designed to be run as a batch process that explores a full
directory and joins all the files with similar names upto scoja
instance identification.
